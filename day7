Todays task is to learn python basics with in depth knowledge. Learning from tutorials point, and use R&D Process to explore more about the working of the Python code. learn about basic concepts like upto OOPs concepts. Not including oops concepts as it is not much useful but i still prefer to do it rather than skipping it on an initial stage.

I think i should mainly focus on the functions and do it in more friendly way bcz without functions there is no any code, Function is everything.
