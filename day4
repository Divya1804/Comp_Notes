Bash Scripting (variables, if-else, loops, input/output)
explore chmod
explore vim editor


BASH SCRIPTING-------
--> A bash shell script is a plain text file containing a set of various commands that we usually type in the command line. used to automate repetitive tasks on Linux filesystem.

--> Comments :- 	1. << COMMENTS .... COMMENTS		2. : ' .... '
NOTE :- Space will be considered as a separation of the items.
--> Wait :- This will be helpful for adding some delay for the task to be completed.

--> Arithmetic operations :- 	(DOUBT :- For float points, how we can show a floating value after decimal value?)

ANS. --> let command will only work for integer values, it is a most useful command to perform arithmetic operations on integer values.
--> (let) only works with integers, not floating-point numbers.


--> Bash IF Statements...
---> -gt --> Grater than	-ge --> Greater than Equal 	-lt --> Less than 	-le --> Less than equal. 	! --> To check whether it is false or true. 	-n --> To check the length of string is greater than zero. 	-z --> To check the length of string is zero. 	== --> To check if 2 strings are equal or not. 	!= --> To check if 2 strings are not equal !!.
---> Syntax :-
	1. Syntax For the simple if else conditions.
	if [[ EXPRESSION ]]
	then 
	echo "..."
	else
	echo "..."
	fi
	
	2. Syntax for only if statements.
	if [[ EXPRESSION ]]
	then
	echo "..."
	fi
	
	3. Syntax for nested if statements.
	if [[ EXPRESSION ]]
	then
	if [[ EXPRESSION 2 ]]
	then
	echo "..."
	fi
	fi
	
	4. Syntax for if_else-if(elif)_else statements.
	if [[ CONDITION ]]
	then
	echo "..."
	elif [[CONDITION ]] 
	then
	echo "..."
	else
	echo "..."
	fi
	
	
--> BASH CASE
	it is used to check the case, like there are many cases and it will give answer according to the case that matches.
	
	1. Syntax for case...
	case [variable or condition] in 
		pattern1)
			echo "..."
			echo
			;;
		pattern2)
			echo "..."
			echo
			;;
		*)
			echo "..."
			echo
			;;
	esac
	
	
--> BASH FOR LOOP
	This is just like a normal for loop in other languages like java, C++ and so on... Its work is to do the same work repetedly for some defined time.
	
	1. syntax for FOR LOOP...
	for variable in list
	do
	commands
	done
	
	2. Syntax for FOR LOOP Like older one...
	for (( exp1, exp2, exp3 ))
	do
	commands
	done
	
--> BASH FUNCTIONS
	Types of parameters 
	1. positional arguments
	2. Special parameters
	3. Named arguments
	
	
	
Today's work:-
1. Started with the revision of the previously done work on yesterday, just did a small revision and practice of those commands and take a small recap.
2. Got my task about exploring chmod command in Linux and granting different permissions to the user of read, write, execute etc...
3. Then i started something new that was really fun, about exploring a BASH Scripting. i explored some basic concepts like comments, variables, echo, writing scripts, exploring case, if else statements, looping statements, arithmetic operations, and functions...
4. Explored vim editor a little bit. (pending...)
